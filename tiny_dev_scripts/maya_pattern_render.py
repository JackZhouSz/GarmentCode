# Render setup:
    # NOTE: rendering contour+translarent backgroud requires at least two images, 
    # So it's easier to render with plain white background instead
    # Render type: contour
    # Background: white (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4XdqwDhKZY)
    # Color management: 
    # "Apply output transform to render" in color management to match the colors

# Shader setup: 
    # AI toon + cloth + colors
    # Render edges by 
        # shader differences
        # UV difference
    # the above is defined in the scene file!
    # Covered UV size!! Should include all UV shells correctly
    # Sheen -- for fabric rendering

# Model
    # Auto UV Layout
    # Stack UV Shells
    # Normalize
    # To maximize the area and allow darts to shor up

# Get the UV Shells
# Get the shader
    

# Define color list

# Setup render - countour 

# Go over UV shells and colors
    # Copy shader into a new one
    # Setup new color
    # Select all faces in the UV shell
    # assign the shader
