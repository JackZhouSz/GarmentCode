# Running simulation of GarmentCode patterns in Autodesk Maya + Qualoth

GarmentCode serializes sewing patterns in a JSON format that extends the file format introduced in our previous project [Garment-Pattern-Generator](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/Garment-Pattern-Generator/). We modified the corresponding tools for Autodesk Maya & Qualoth to support the GUI designed for an pipeline.

## Running GarmentViewer

GarmentCode supports the `garment_viewer` -- GUI script for Maya that loads and simulated sewing patterns from JSON. 

> !! Important !! Check the instructions for [Installation](Installation.md).

Using this tool is exactly the same as in the original project, follow the instrustions here: [Garment Viewer](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/Garment-Pattern-Generator/blob/master/docs/Setting_up_generator.md#preview-your-setup-in-garmentviewer-gui)
