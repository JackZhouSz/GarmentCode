# GarmentCode: Programming Parametric Sewing Patterns

Implementation of GarmentCode architecture and garment programs.

## Installation

### Install python with dependencies:

* Python 3.9 or 3.11
* numpy
* scipy
* [svgwrite](https://pypi.org/project/svgwrite/)
* psutil
* matplotlib
* [svgpathtools](https://github.com/mathandy/svgpathtools)
* [cairoSVG](https://cairosvg.org/)
    NOTE: this lib has some quirks on Windows, which we relove with including needed dlls in `./external/cairo_dlls` and adding the ditrectory to PATH in runtime
* [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI) to run GUI script

All python dependencies can be installed with 

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
or 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

NOTE: 
* The dependency on [Pattern Generator](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/Garment-Pattern-Generator) is included in the repo (`./external`), and will be loaded automatically by test script
* The environemtal variables needed for correct lib loading are set up in the test script

### Configuration of local paths

Same as here: https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/Garment-Pattern-Generator/blob/master/docs/Installation.md#local-paths-setup

NOTE: ATM only the 'output' path is actually used, so setting only that one is enough


## How to run (command line)

From the root directory run
```
python test_garments.py
```

It will create sewing pattern for the current state of `assets/design_params/base.yaml` for average SMPL body, and put it to the logs folder. Modify the parameters inside the script as needed.

## How to run (GUI)

WARNING: Currently in active development, quality not guaranteed ðŸ˜…

From the root directory run
```
python gui.py
```

It can load body and design parameter files and display the corresponding sewing pattern right away.
Design files should be compatible with `MetaGarment` object (all examples provided in `assets\design_params` are compatible).

SOON: displaying garment parameters for direct manipulation

## Modifying the parameters

`./assets/design_params/base.yaml` contains the full set of style parameters for creating samples of our garment configurator.

* Update some of parameter values ('v:' field under parameter name) withing a given range 
* run `test_garments.py` 
* `./Logs/base_<timestamp>` will contain the sewing patterns corresponding to given values


## Attribution
We are using samples from [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/) body model as base for [Body Model examples](assets/Bodies). 


## TODO

### Notes
* cairo_dlls windows

### Installation for Maya
The contects of this directory are modified from the code of https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/Garment-Pattern-Generator (pattern package)

Add current directory (`./external`) to PYTHONPATH for Maya to use this version when loading garment viewer or running batch sumulation. 

The entry script for garment viewer is the same as in the original project and can be taken from there.

Additional dependencies in this version: 
* [svgpathtools](https://github.com/mathandy/svgpathtools)
* [cairoSVG](https://cairosvg.org/)
    NOTE: this lib has some quirks on Windows, which we relove with including needed dlls in `./external/cairo_dlls` and adding the ditrectory to PATH in runtime
* -svglib- removed!

These are need to be installed in Maya Python with the rest of the libs from original project.
