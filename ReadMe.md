# Parametric Procedural Garments [Ongoing Project]

![Examples of Garments generated with our pipeline](img/data_samples.png)



Based on official implementation of [Generating Datasets of 3D Garments with Sewing Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05633).

## News!

* Nov. 21, 2022: switched to using Maya 2022+. NOTE: Support for earlier versions is removed. Use the state before the last merge to use the generator with Maya below 2022

## Dataset


## Docs
Provided in `./docs` folder

* [Dependencies and Installation instructions](docs/Installation.md)
* [Configuring dataset generation](docs/Setting_up_generator.md) - from sewing pattern template to physics simulation components.
* [Running data generation](docs/Running_generation.md) - getting all the steps right & additional helpful operations.
* [Sewing pattern template specification](docs/template_spec_with_comments.json) - spec example with comments to all the elements.
